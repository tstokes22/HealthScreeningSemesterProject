## Health Screening & Analytics System

### FSU Computer Science Semester Project

# Project Overview

The Health Screening System is a full-stack web application designed for secure health metric tracking and administrative data oversight. It bridges the gap between patient self-reporting and administrative analytics, providing a robust platform for monitoring health trends across a user base.
Technical Architecture

This project follows a structured Client-Server architecture utilizing the following stack:

Frontend: Built with responsive HTML5 and CSS3. It leverages the Fetch API for asynchronous communication with the backend, ensuring a smooth, single-page-feel for dashboard interactions.

Backend: Developed in PHP with a modular directory structure (/api, /includes, /css).

Database: MySQL relational database consisting of a users table for credentials and a health_entries table for health data, linked via foreign keys.

Data Visualization: Integrated Chart.js to render dynamic line graphs for user health trends and registration analytics.

# Core Features & Logic Implementation

1. Secure Authentication & Session Management

Hashed Security: Implements password_hash and password_verify for user credentials and secret answers.

Session-Based Guarding: Uses session_start() and custom utility functions (isLoggedIn(), requireAdmin()) to protect sensitive endpoints from unauthorized access.

Password Recovery: Features a two-step recovery process using Secret Questions and answers persisted in PHP sessions to verify identity before a reset.

2. Patient Health Tracking

Metric Logging: A data entry form for symptoms, temperature (°F), blood pressure, and heart rate.

Dynamic Trends: The system automatically sorts historical data by date and renders a multi-axis line chart using Chart.js to visualize physiological changes over time.

3. Administrative Oversight & Analytics

Admin Dashboard: Grants administrators the ability to view, insert, edit, and delete user accounts (CRUD operations).

Registration Analytics: Uses complex SQL aggregation (e.g., YEARWEEK and DATE_FORMAT) to generate daily, weekly, and monthly registration reports.

Real-time Activity: Monitors user engagement by tracking last_login timestamps and calculating active vs. inactive users within a 24-hour window.

# Security Best Practices Implemented

SQL Injection Prevention: Every database interaction utilizes Prepared Statements with bind_param to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.

Unauthorized Access Protection: Admin-specific APIs (delete_user.php, view_users.php) include server-side checks to verify the is_admin session flag before execution.

CSRF/Session Security: Implements session_regenerate_id(true) upon login to prevent session fixation attacks.

# Setup & Local Environment

Configure Database: Import the schema logic found in setup.php into your MySQL environment.

Connection Setup: Update includes/db_connect.php with your local host, database name, and credentials.

Deployment: Place the project directory in a PHP-enabled server environment (e.g., XAMPP/WAMP htdocs).

Initial Admin: Use the default credentials generated by setup.php (admin / admin123) to access the Analytics Dashboard.
